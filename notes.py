#  Designer patterns are well-known solutions to recurring problems...
# that are widely accepted in the software development community.

# there are three types of designer patterns

#creational
    # used to create objects systematically
    # flexible
    # polymorphism is mostly used
    
#structural
    # establish relationships between software components
    # accomplish functional and non-functional goals
    # inheritance is mostly used
    
#behavioral
    # makes objects interact with each other
    # methods
    
    
# designer patterns require the use of objected oriented programming


# unconventional ways of strengthening application

# Design patterns require the use of objected oriented programming
# it is almost irrelevant to non-objected oriented programming.


# inheritance establishes relationship between classes as parent and child.
# child class keeps the attributes and methods of the parent class and adds it own.
# it can also override the existing attributes and methods of the parents

# pattern context

# 1, Participants
    # refers to the classes involved in forming the design pattern.
    # each class plays a different role.
    
# 2, Quality attributes
    # Non-functional requirements.
    # usability, modifiability, reliability, performance and more.
    # has effect on the entire software ~ architectural solutions
    
# 3, Forces
    # various factors and tradeofs to be considered.
    # it will be manifested in the quality attributes.
    
# 4, Consequences
    # Worse performance
    # decision makers should consider consequences.
    

# pattern problem

# Name
    # capture the gist
    # it should be meaningful and memorable.
    
# Context
    # insights on when and where to use the pattern.

# Problemo
    # challenge pattern is trying to address.

# Solution
    # specifies pattern
    # structure ~ relationship
    # behaviours ~ interactions

# Related patterns
    # list other patterns that are used together
    # similar but different
